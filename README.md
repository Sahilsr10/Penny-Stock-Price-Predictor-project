## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager



## üì¶ Dependencies

```
streamlit>=1.25.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.23.0
matplotlib>=3.6.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
yfinance>=0.2.0
scikit-learn>=1.2.0
plotly>=5.15.0
```

## üîß Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Authentication**: Enter the password to access the application
2. **Stock Selection**: Choose from available penny stocks in the sidebar
3. **Date Range**: Set your analysis period (minimum 50 days recommended)
4. **Model Selection**: Pick between Random Forest or Linear Regression
5. **Analysis**: Click "Run Analysis" to fetch data and train the model
6. **Results**: View predictions, metrics, and visualizations

### Key Components

#### Technical Indicators
- **SMA (5, 10, 20)**: Simple Moving Averages
- **RSI**: Relative Strength Index (14-period)
- **Volatility**: 10-day rolling standard deviation
- **Lag Features**: Previous day price and volume data

#### Model Evaluation Metrics
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error
- **R¬≤ Score**: Coefficient of determination
- **Feature Importance**: Ranking of input variables (Random Forest only)

## üìä Model Architecture

### Feature Engineering
The application creates 13 key features from raw OHLCV data:

- Basic OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
- Technical indicators (SMA_5, SMA_10, SMA_20, RSI)
- Market dynamics (Price_Change, Volatility)
- Temporal features (Close_Lag1, Close_Lag2, Volume_Lag1)

### Machine Learning Models

#### Random Forest Regressor
- **Ensemble method** with 100 decision trees
- **Handles non-linear relationships** effectively
- **Feature importance analysis** included
- **Robust to outliers** and missing data

#### Linear Regression
- **Simple baseline model** for comparison
- **Fast training and prediction**
- **Interpretable coefficients**
- **Good for linear relationships**

## üé® User Interface

### Dashboard Components
- **Configuration Panel**: Stock selection, date range, model choice
- **Dataset Overview**: Key statistics and metrics
- **Price Visualization**: Interactive time series charts
- **Model Performance**: Evaluation metrics display
- **Prediction Results**: Future price forecast with analysis
- **Feature Analysis**: Importance rankings (Random Forest)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**Important**: This application is designed for educational and research purposes only. Stock market predictions are inherently uncertain and should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions. Always consult with financial professionals before making investment choices.

## üîí Security Notes

- Default password is set to `password123` for demonstration
- In production, use environment variables or Streamlit secrets for authentication
- Consider implementing more robust authentication for real-world deployment
